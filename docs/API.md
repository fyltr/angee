# HTTP API

The operator exposes an HTTP API for the CLI, dashboards, CI, agents, and backend control planes.

The API must call the same operator services used by CLI commands. It must not implement a separate provisioning path.

## Authentication

When `ANGEE_API_KEY` is configured, all endpoints except health checks require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

## Core Endpoints

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Operator liveness and basic state-source/backend information. |
| `GET /manifest` | Return the current `angee.yaml` as YAML or JSON. |
| `PUT /manifest` | Validate and write `angee.yaml`, then optionally reconcile. |
| `POST /stack/init` | Initialize a stack from a stack template. Mirrors `angee stack init`. |
| `POST /stack/update` | Update the current stack from its active template. Mirrors `angee stack update`. |
| `POST /workspace/init` | Provision a workspace. Mirrors `angee workspace init`. |
| `POST /workspace/update` | Update a workspace. Mirrors `angee workspace update`. |
| `POST /agent/init` | Provision an agent-backed workspace. Mirrors `angee agent init`. |
| `POST /agent/update` | Update an agent-backed workspace. Mirrors `angee agent update`. |
| `POST /reconcile` | Reconcile current desired state to actual state. |
| `POST /deploy` | Compile and apply deployment backend changes. |
| `POST /rollback` | Roll back to a prior stack revision when file/git state is enabled. |
| `GET /status` | List service, job, workflow, source, port lease, workspace, and agent state. |
| `GET /logs` | Stream or tail logs for services, jobs, workflows, and agents. |

## Init Request Shape

All init endpoints use the same model:

```json
{
  "template": "stacks/dev",
  "ref": "v1.2.3",
  "path": "../my-app",
  "answers": {
    "project_name": "my-app"
  },
  "secrets": {
    "anthropic-api-key": "env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  },
  "ports": {
    "web": 8120
  },
  "sources": {
    "app": {
      "ref": "feat-x",
      "tree": "."
    }
  }
}
```

The operator resolves the template, renders with Copier, materializes sources, resolves secrets, allocates port leases, writes manifests/state, and reconciles resources.

## State Sources

The API can be backed by any configured state sources:

- `file`
- `django-api`
- `django-db`
- future Temporal persistence

State-source choice must not change the API resource model.
