# Architecture

Status: target architecture for the fresh refactor

Angee has one user model: templates create `angee.yaml`, and the operator reconciles that manifest.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `angee` CLI | User interface. Has the operator compiled in, starts or reuses a local operator process, and submits HTTP requests. |
| operator | Shared provisioning and reconciliation engine, runnable as an embedded local process or a standalone service. |
| `angee.yaml` | Desired-state manifest under `$ANGEE_ROOT`. |
| Copier templates | Render or update stack, workspace, and agent files. |
| Deployment backend | Runs actual workloads. Docker Compose first, Kubernetes later. |
| State sources | Files, Django API, Django database, and future Temporal persistence. Multiple sources can be used together. |

## Command Flow

```text
user
  -> angee CLI
  -> embedded local operator process or running operator service
  -> provisioning/reconcile pipeline
  -> deployment backend and state sources
```

The CLI must not duplicate provisioning logic. Stack, workspace, agent, service, and MCP server provisioning all go through the operator path.

Local commands use the same shape as remote control: the CLI spawns or reuses an operator process for the selected ANGEE_ROOT, waits for `/health`, then calls the operator API. This keeps `angee dev`, `angee up`, `angee deploy`, `angee stack init`, `angee workspace init`, and `angee agent init` DRY.

## Manifest

The only Angee manifest is:

```text
$ANGEE_ROOT/angee.yaml
```

It can declare:

- active template and Copier state
- sources
- volumes
- secrets
- port leases
- services
- jobs
- workflows
- workspaces
- agents
- MCP servers
- operator and deployment backend settings

There is no `.angee/project.yaml` and no separate project mode.

## Resource Model

| Resource | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Source | Named content tree with `kind`, `ref`, `tree`, and `target`. Sources can be GitHub/git, local path, URL, object store, Google Drive, archive, template output, or volume. |
| Volume | Persistent storage mounted into sources, services, or jobs. |
| Service | Long-running workload. Maps to Compose services or Kubernetes workloads. |
| Job | One-shot workload. Maps to Compose run or Kubernetes Job/CronJob. |
| Workflow | Ordered orchestration of activities. Inline locally, Temporal-backed later. |
| Port lease | Named host port allocation. |
| Agent | Durable actor attached to a workspace and one or more services. |
| MCP server | Tool endpoint exposed to agents. |

## Provisioning Pipeline

The operator pipeline is:

```text
resolve template
render/update with Copier
write/update angee.yaml
materialize sources
resolve secrets
allocate port leases
create volumes/state dirs
provision services/jobs/workflows/workspaces/agents/MCP servers
compile backend files when needed
apply backend changes
observe status and logs
write state sources
```

This same pipeline is used by:

- `angee stack init`
- `angee workspace init`
- `angee agent init`
- `angee dev`
- HTTP API
- MCP API
- Django backend control plane

## Templates

Templates are Copier templates in this layout:

```text
templates/stacks/<name>/
templates/workspaces/<name>/
templates/agents/<name>/
```

Angee owns template resolution and `_angee` metadata. Copier owns rendering and update mechanics.

## Development

`angee dev` starts or reuses the embedded local operator process. The operator reads `.angee/angee.yaml`, reconciles sources, secrets, port leases, jobs, and services, and streams logs to the CLI.

## Deployment

Docker Compose is the first deployment backend. The operator can compile Angee resources into `docker-compose.yaml` and apply them.

Kubernetes is the target scale-out backend. The same Angee resources compile to Kubernetes Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Jobs, CronJobs, PVCs, and Secrets.

Temporal is the target durable workflow backend for long-running provisioning and deployment workflows.

## State Sources

The operator can combine state sources:

```sh
angee operator --state-source file
angee operator --state-source file --state-source django-api
angee operator --state-source django-api --state-source django-db
```

`file` stores local state under `$ANGEE_ROOT/state/`. `django-api` uses backend APIs. `django-db` reads and writes the Django database directly when colocated.

## Non-Goals

- No backward compatibility with `.angee-template.yaml`.
- No `.angee/project.yaml`.
- No CLI-only provisioning implementation.
- No framework-specific behavior hardcoded in Go.
- No one-Copier-question-per-port pattern.
