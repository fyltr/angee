# Getting started

Angee is a self-managed stack manager: a Go CLI (`angee`) and an HTTP
operator (`angee-operator`) that pulls source repositories, renders them
into Stacks for production and into Workspaces for development, and runs
the result on docker-compose or process-compose.

If you have not already, skim [Concepts](/guide/concepts) first — it
explains what the engine does, what a **Host** is (e.g. `angee-django`
is the first default Host), and the difference between abstract terms
(Stack template, Block) and concrete runtime objects (Source, Workspace,
Service).

## Install

From a release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://angee.ai/install.sh | sh
```

From a checkout:

```sh
make install
```

`make install` builds `dist/angee` and `dist/angee-operator`, then runs
`scripts/install.sh` against those local binaries. Set `ANGEE_INSTALL_DIR`
to install somewhere other than `/usr/local/bin`.

Requirements:

- Docker, for `runtime: container` Services.
- `process-compose`, for `runtime: local` Services.
- `git`, for git-kind Sources.
- A configured Host (typically [`angee-django`](https://github.com/fyltr/angee-django)) when bootstrapping with `angee init --dev`.

## First commands

Angee operates on one `ANGEE_ROOT` containing `angee.yaml`. The CLI
walks upward from the current directory; in a dev checkout that ships
workspace templates, it uses `.angee/`.

```sh
angee doctor       # check tooling and root
angee status       # show stack + service state
angee up           # start container Services
angee dev          # start container + local Services together
```

To bootstrap a fresh stack from a Stack template:

```sh
angee init --dev --yes
```

`--dev` resolves the `dev` Stack template through the configured
template search paths (see [Templates](/guide/templates)). The default
Host that ships a `dev` Stack template is
[`angee-django`](https://github.com/fyltr/angee-django) — its
`templates/stacks/dev/` is what gets rendered when you run `angee init
--dev` from inside that repo or its workspaces.

## A typical development loop

```sh
# Develop a feature in an isolated Workspace
angee workspace create dev-pr --name fix-issue-123 --start
angee workspace status fix-issue-123

# Iterate. Each Source is a git worktree on workspace/fix-issue-123.
angee dev
# … edit code …
angee workspace push fix-issue-123          # push every Source's branch

# Promote to production
git -C ~/prod/.angee pull
angee --operator https://operator.example.com stack up
```

The same `angee.yaml` drives both the Workspace and the production
Stack. The only difference is which root the operator points at.
