# Angee Quick Start

Status: target after template refactor

Angee runs a stack from one manifest: `$ANGEE_ROOT/angee.yaml`.

The CLI has the operator compiled in. Local commands start or reuse an embedded operator process, then call its HTTP API. The operator provisions templates, resolves sources, allocates ports, manages secrets, and reconciles services, jobs, workflows, workspaces, agents, and MCP servers.

## Install

```sh
curl https://angee.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Or with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install angee
```

## Local Dev

Bootstrap a project-local dev stack:

```sh
angee stack init dev --yes
angee dev
```

`angee init --yes` is shorthand for the default stack init. In a project with a `stacks/dev` template, it resolves to `angee stack init dev --yes`.

`angee dev` starts or reuses the embedded local operator process and reconciles from `.angee/angee.yaml`.

## Staging

Create a Docker-backed staging stack:

```sh
angee stack init staging-docker \
  --set domain=staging.example.com \
  --secret anthropic-api-key=env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --yes

angee up
```

## Workspaces

Create a feature workspace with its own sources, services, state, and port leases:

```sh
angee workspace init feat-refactor-2 --branch feat-refactor-2 --yes
angee workspace dev feat-refactor-2
```

Update it from its template:

```sh
angee workspace update feat-refactor-2
```

## Agents

Create an agent-backed workspace:

```sh
angee agent init feat-refactor-2 \
  --branch feat-refactor-2 \
  --template agents/claude-code \
  --workspace-template workspaces/feature-dev \
  --secret anthropic-api-key=env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --start \
  --yes
```

Interact with the agent:

```sh
angee agent chat feat-refactor-2
angee agent ask feat-refactor-2 "summarize the current branch"
angee agent logs feat-refactor-2 --follow
```

## Updates

Update the current stack from its active template:

```sh
angee stack update
```

The operator rerenders the template with Copier, preserves generated secrets and port leases unless explicitly changed, then reconciles actual state from `angee.yaml`.

## Common Commands

```sh
angee stack init <name> [path]
angee stack update
angee dev
angee up
angee deploy
angee status
angee logs <service>
angee workspace init <name>
angee workspace update <name>
angee agent init <name>
angee agent update <name>
```
